## Planning

I first created curl scripts to test my authentication reqests with the serve
and focused on creating my authentication features. A user would be able to sign up,
sign-in, sign-out, change password.  As a user you have access to a list of all
the viable pokemon you could use in the Over Used (OU) tier competetive battling
scene.  The list will consist of Pokemon that are OU tier, but would also include
Pokemon of lower tiers which would include, Under Used (UU) and Under Used Border-
line(UUBL). The OU tier would rank the heighest, UUBL would rank second heighest,
and UU would be the lowest tier in this list.

```
OU > UUBL > UU
```

The User will be able to able to pick 6 pokemon and add it to their personal team.
They would be able to view their pokemon and nickname them.  You'll be able to
see their typings, tier and overall base stats.  You can remove pokemon from your
team and add another if you'd like as well.
## Development Process
Things went according to the overall plan. You'd be able to view a list of all the
pokemon you could use in competetitive play through a database seeded with all the
viable pokemon. For the update feature of my project I allowed the user to
nickname the Pokemon in their team. They can also remove and add other pokemon
as well.

## Unsolved Problems
- I wanted to display their strengths and overall weaknesses to other typings
- I have to figure out how to iterate through the list of pokemon in a team
- I would then compare their strengths and weaknesses to other pokemon in the list

## Future Features
I want to be able to view the team's strengths and weaknesses to other pokemon
